  "Have you ever noticed how older people keep mentioning that time keeps moving faster and faster?",
  "It's because we perceive time relative to the 'absolute' time we can compare it to...",
  "When you are 4 weeks old, a week is a quarter of your life.",
  "By the end of your first year, a week is just a fiftieth of your life.",
  "By the time you turn 50, a whole year will be a fiftieth of your life.",
  "This theory was first put forward by Paul Janet in 1897.",
  "He then was 21.",
  "Like many things, this will require some patience to get through.",
  "But in the end it'll be over faster than you thought or hoped it would be.",
  "Albert Einstein said about the perception of time, that 'an hour spent in the company of pretty girls passes more quickly than an hour spent in a dentist chair'.",
  "He died at 76.",
  "Waiting 24 days for Christmas at age 5 feels like waiting a year at age 76.",
  "According to this theory, assuming you'll become 100 years old, half of your perceived life is over at age 7.",
  "If you factor in that you don't remember much of the first three years, then half your perceived life is over by the time you turn 18.",
  "Did you notice how much faster the 10th year scrolled by than the first?",
  "Your summer vacation in your first year in college will feel as long as your whole 76th year.",
  "Thanks for taking the time to scroll through all of this by the way.",
  "After 30 the acceleration slows, each year from then on will be under 3% of your life and similarly short.",
  "See how fast years rush by in your Thirties!",
  "There are also interesting parallels between time and money.",
  "Money and time are both saved and spent. Some say that time equals money.",
  "The more money is in the market, the less it becomes worth.",
  "Similarly, the more time you've lived, the shorter each year feels.",
  "Time is subject to inflation!",
  "Who knew?!",
  "Time flies. We tell ourselves we can always do this or that thing later. Open a bar when we get older. Put off that trip we've been thinking about for a while.",
  "Life is short. Do things now!"
